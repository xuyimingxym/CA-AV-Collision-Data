Traffic slowed quickly due to a crash ahead of the Ghost car. Consistent with their training, the Ghost driver took control by braking and disengaging the autonomous system. The Ghost car stopped without impacting the preceding car. A Mercedes car immediately following the Ghost car also came to a stop without impacting the Ghost car. Ghost's understanding based on communications at the scene is that a Grand Cherokee traveling behind the Mercedes tried to swerve to avoid impacting the Mercedes but clipped the Mercedes and rolled over. To Ghost's knowledge, nobody in the Grand Cherokee was injured. The Ghost drivers heard a noise and then found that the rear bumper of the Ghost car had been damaged, which Ghost believes resulted from crash debris.
